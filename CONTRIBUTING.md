This guide is just a handful of content about Javascript, there is no larger goal behind it besides exposing people to JS in order to spark their curiosity and look for different ways to solve their problems and learn programming concepts.

Feel free to open issues/discussions or send pull requests if you find any typo, misinformation or wrong example!

If you'd like to contribute with more content please open an issue so we can discuss about it beforehand to avoiding writing a lot of text that might not get merged into the final document.
